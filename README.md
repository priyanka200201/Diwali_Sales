# Diwali Sales Analysis
Overview

This repository contains Python code for analyzing Diwali sales data. The analysis involves data cleaning, manipulation, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using popular libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.

Features
Data Cleaning and Manipulation: The raw sales data is loaded and cleaned, handling missing values and removing duplicates. Manipulation techniques are applied to prepare the data for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): The data is explored to gain insights into sales trends. Visualizations using matplotlib and seaborn provide a better understanding of sales distribution, profit vs. expenses, and monthly sales trends.

Customer Segmentation: The analysis identifies potential customers based on different factors, including states, occupation, gender, and age groups. This can help improve customer experience and tailor marketing strategies.

Product Analysis: The project improves sales strategies by identifying the most selling product categories and individual products. This information is valuable for inventory planning, ensuring that the business can meet the demands during Diwali sales.
